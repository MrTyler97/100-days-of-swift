// Different view stacks, Vstack -> vertical view, Hstack -> horizontal view, Zstack -> depth view - layers views (adding text over an image)
//.ignoreSafeArea allow you to fill entire screen
//.background(.ultrThinMaterial) is used often in Swfit UI for frosted window effect.
//Gradients -> LinearGradient (Goes in one direction),              RadialGradient(Outward circle),AngularGradient(Cycles around point) '.gradient' is used often in swift to make designs better. Use this after any color
// Images - > Image(decorative: "nameOfFile") the files would be stored in assets. 'systemName:' -> uses Appleâ€™s SF Symbols icon collection, and you can search for icons you like
// Alerts - > .alert() creates a pop up on the screen.
